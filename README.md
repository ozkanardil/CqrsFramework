# CqrsFramework
Welcome to my open-source project repository for a clean-coded, ready-to-use web-based application development framework built in .NET Core. 

The aim of this project is to help software developers to start a new project quickly with a solid foundation for a scalable, maintainable, and testable architecture.

The framework is built using Domain Driven Design (DDD) pattern and Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) principles to provide a clear separation of concerns between application layers. 

The project consists of 5 layers, namely the API, application, infrastructure, domain, and persistence layers. Cross-cutting concerns such as logging, JWT token, and standard response models are also added to make the framework even more robust.

As a software developer myself, I know how difficult it can be to start a new project from scratch. That's why I wanted to create something that would make it easier for others. I pay attention to follow SOLID principles to ensure that the code is clean and maintainable. I believe that sharing this framework will benefit the software development community and make a positive contribution to the industry.

This repository is open to everyone who wants to use it, contribute to it, or learn from it. 

Feel free to clone, download, and explore the code. 

If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out. 

I hope this project will help you to start your next project with confidence
